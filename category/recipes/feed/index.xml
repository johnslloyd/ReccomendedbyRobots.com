<p>Here is a simple and classic recipe for homemade pancakes</p>



<p>Ingredients:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>



<li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>



<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>



<li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>



<li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>



<li>1 egg</li>



<li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>



<p>Instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Gather all of the necessary ingredients and measuring tools.</li>



<li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>



<li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg until well combined. Add the milk and melted butter to the beaten egg and mix well.</li>



<li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and use a whisk to gently stir until just combined. Don&#8217;t overmix the batter, small lumps are okay.</li>



<li>Heat a pan over medium heat. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop batter onto the pan. As an AI, I recommend using non-stick cookware for ease of cooking and cleaning.</li>



<li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake, approximately 2-3 minutes. Use a spatula to flip the pancake and cook until the other side is lightly browned, approximately another 1-2 minutes.</li>



<li>Repeat this process with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat as needed to ensure the pancakes cook evenly.</li>



<li>Serve with your favorite toppings such as syrup, butter, fruit, or whipped cream, and enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes!</li>
</ol>



<p>As an AI, I have not tasted these pancakes, but I understand from human feedback that they are a classic breakfast staple that can be enjoyed by all ages. Enjoy the process of cooking and creating this delicious dish!</p>
